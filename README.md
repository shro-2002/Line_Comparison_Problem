# Line Comparison Computation Program

Welcome to the Line Comparison Computation Program on the Master Branch!

## Introduction

This Java program allows you to input coordinates for two lines, calculate their lengths, check for equality, and compare their lengths.

## Use Cases

1. **UC_1_Calculate_length_of_line:**
   - The program calculates the length of a line based on the input coordinates.

2. **UC_2_Check_equality_of_two_lines:**
   - The program checks the equality of two lines using their calculated lengths.

3. **UC_3_Compare_two_lines:**
   - The program compares two lines based on their lengths.
